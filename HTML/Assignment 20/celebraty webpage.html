            <strong>Taraka Rama Rao</strong> (28 May 1923 – 18 January 1996), often referred to by his initials NTR, was an Indian
            actor, filmmaker and politician who served as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh for seven years over three terms. He
            starred in over 300 films, predominantly in Telugu cinema, and was referred by the media as Viswa Vikhyatha Nata
            Sarvabhouma (transl. Universally-renowned star of acting).Rao received three National Film Awards for
            co-producing Thodu Dongalu (1954) and Seetharama Kalyanam (1960) under National Art Theater, Madras, and for
            directing Varakatnam (1970). Known for his breakthrough performances in Raju Peda (1954) and Lava Kusa
            (1963), Rao garnered the Nandi Award for Best Actor for Kodalu Diddina Kapuram in 1970, and the Inaugural

            Rama Rao made his debut as an actor in a Telugu social film Mana Desam, directed by L. V. Prasad in 1949. He gained
            popularity in the 1950s when he became well known for his portrayals of Hindu deities, especially Krishna, Shiva and
            Rama, roles which have made him a "messiah of the masses", and a prominent figure in the history of cinema.
            He later became known for portraying antagonistic characters and Robin Hood-esque hero characters in
            films. N. T. R. was voted "Greatest Indian Actor of All Time" in a CNN-IBN national poll conducted
            in 2013 on the occasion of the Centenary of Indian Cinema.

            Rao was awarded the <b>Padma Shri</b>by the Government of India in 1968, recognizing his contribution to Indian cinema.
            After his career in films, Rao entered politics. He founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982 and served three
            tumultuous terms as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 1983 and 1995. He was known as an advocate of Andhra
            Pradesh's distinct cultural identity, distinguishing it from the erstwhile Madras State with which it was often
            associated. At the national level, he was instrumental in the formation of the National Front, a coalition of
            non-Congress parties which governed India from 1989 until 1990.

        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
           
            Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was born in a Hindu agrarian family on 28 May 1923 in Nimmakuru, a small village in
            Gudivada taluk of Krishna district, which was a part of the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India. He was
            given in adoption to his paternal uncle because his uncle and aunt were childless. He was first educated by a
            teacher who came from a nearby village, whom he would attribute his command of Telugu to, as well as his father, an
            aspiring thespian and patron of the arts. Although children were normally pulled out of school after completing
            their primary education, on account of being the first male child in the family, his father sent him to Vijayawada,
            where he continued his education, matriculating in 1940 before studying at SRR & CVR College and at the Andhra
            Christian College in Guntur. In 1947, he joined the Madras Service Commission as a sub-registrar at Prathipadu
            of Guntur district, a much-coveted job that he nevertheless quit within three weeks to devote himself to acting.
            He developed a baritone singing voice as a young man.

            Rama Rao started his film career with a walk-on role as a policeman in Mana Desam (1949). Following this, he
            appeared in Palletoori Pilla (1950), directed by B. A. Subba Rao. His first mythological film was in 1957, where
            he portrayed the Hindu god Krishna in the blockbuster film Maya Bazaar. He played Krishna in 17 films,
            including some landmark films such as Sri Krishnarjuna Yudham (1962), the Tamil film Karnan (1964) and Daana Veera
            Soora Karna (1977). He was also known for his portrayal of the god Rama, essaying that role in films such as Lava
            Kusa (1963) and Sri Ramanjaneya Yuddham (1974) to name a few. He has also portrayed other characters from the
            Ramayana, such as Ravana in Bhookailas (1958) and Seetharama Kalyanam (1961) among others. He portrayed the god
            Vishnu in films such as Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam (1960) among others and the god Shiva in Dakshayagnam (1962). He

            Later in his career, he stopped playing a prince in his commercial films and began to play roles of a poor yet
            heroic young man fighting against the existing system. These films appealed to the sentiments of the common man.
            Some of these films are Devudu Chesina Manushulu (1973), Adavi Ramudu (1977), Driver Ramudu (1979), Vetagadu (1979),
            Sardar Papa Rayudu (1980), Kondaveeti Simham (1981), Justice Chowdary (1982) and Bobbili Puli (1982). He also
            portrayed fantasy roles, his notable film in that genre being Yamagola (1977).[citation needed] His film Lava Kusa,
            in which he starred as Rama, collected ₹1 crore in 1963. He directed and acted in the hagiographical film
            Srimadvirat Veerabrahmendra Swami Charitra (1984). He also acted in films such as Brahmashi Viswamitra (1991) and
            Major Chandrakanth (1993). His last film was Srinatha Kavi Sarvabhowmudu, a biopic on the Telugu poet Srinatha,
            which released in 1993.
